<h1>Mars</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and takes 686.93 Earth days to orbit around the sun. A day on Mars last 24h 39m 35 seconds in Earth hours. Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the diameter of Earth and has the same amount of dry land. </p>
<h2 class="sub-headings">How it got its name</h2>
<p>The Romans were great soldiers and thought Mars, the god of war, was very important. Mars, the red planet, was named after this god of war. According to Roman myth, Mars rode on a chariot pulled by two horses named Phobos and Deimos (meaning fear and panic). The two small moons of Mars are named after these two mythical horses.</p>
<h3 class="sub-headings">Appearance</h3>
<p>Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons and weather, but its atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but evidence for water now exists mainly in icy soil and thin clouds.</p>
