<h1>Mercury</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Mercury is the closest orbiting planet to the sun in our solar system. Mercury goes around the sun the fastest of all the planets. Mercury has no moons. Mercury goes around the sun once every 88 Earth days. A day on Mercury lasts a lot longer than a day on Earth. One day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days.</p>
<h2 class="sub-headings">How It Got It's Name</h2>
<p>The Romans believed that gods and goddesses were in charge of everything on Earth. Mercury is named after the messenger for their gods. The Roman Mercury had wings on his helmet and shoes and could travel very quickly from place to place. Mercury moves quickly around the sun thus receiving its name.</p>
<h3 class="sub-headings">Appearance</h3>
<p>The surface of Mercury looks like earth’s moon covered with impact craters. Mercury has almost no atmosphere. The planet's small size means that its gravity is too weak to hold down a normal atmosphere. Humans can not survive on Mercury.</p>
