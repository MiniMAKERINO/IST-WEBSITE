<h1>Uranus</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>The seventh planet from the sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the sun like a rolling ball. A day on Uranus would last 17h 14m and a year would on Uranus would last 84 Earth years.</p>
<h2 class="sub-headings">How it got its name</h2>
<p>The Romans named the five planets closest to the Sun after their most important gods. These were the only planets that were bright enough for them to see. Later, when telescopes were used, other planets were discovered. Astronomers decided to continue naming the planets after Roman Gods with one exception - Uranus. Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky. According to myth, he was the father of Saturn and the grandfather of Jupiter.</p>
<h3 class="sub-headings">Appearance</h3>
<p>Uranus is a blue and greenish color due to the methane in its atmosphere. It has a very light ring system that is hardly seen, with only nine rings clearly seen. Uranus' rings are as dark, like Jupiter's, but composed of large objects, as well as, fine dust. There are 11 rings, Epsilon being the brightest.</p>
