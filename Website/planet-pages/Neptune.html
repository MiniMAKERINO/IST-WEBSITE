<h1>Neptune</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, Neptune is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth, the planet takes almost 165 Earth years to orbit our sun and a day last 16h 6m 14 seconds.</p>
<h2 class="sub-headings">How it got its name</h2>
<p>The Romans named the five planets closest to the Sun after their most important gods. These were the only planets that were bright enough for them to see. Later, when telescopes were used, other planets were discovered. Astronomers decided to continue naming the planets after Roman Gods. Neptune, a blueish planet, was named after the Roman god of the sea.</p>
<h3 class="sub-headings">Appearance</h3>
<p>Neptune looks is a blue planet with one very large dark spot (called the Great Dark Spot), and few smaller spots that come and go. These dark spots are very severe storms. Neptune has 6 faint rings that appear to be twisted. It also has many incomplete rings called arcs.  Next, this planet has 13 moons, of all different shapes and sizes.  Finally, thin, white clouds streak across the planet.</p>
