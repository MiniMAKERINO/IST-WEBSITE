<h1>Venus</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Often described as earth’s sister. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun and is earth’s closest planetary neighbour. It orbits the sun in 224.7 earth days and has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in our solar system, while also rotating in the opposite direction of most other planets. One day on Venus is equivalent to 116 days on earth. Just like Mercury, Venus does not have any moons orbiting them.
</p>
<h2 class="sub-headings">How it got its name</h2>
<p>Venus,is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet — the only planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her pantheon because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers at the time.</p>
<h3 class="sub-headings">Appearance</h3>
<p>Venus is the one of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system which means that it is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. The planet is mostly covered by lava flows and has several volcanoes. There also are craters, on the surface, that are bunched up together because of meteors breaking up into the atmosphere. The planet’s surface is very dry and arid.</p>
